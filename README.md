# NU-10 : OHLC ENGINE
## Overview
### OHLC Chart :
* An OHLC chart is a type of bar-chart that shows open, high, low, and closing prices for each period. OHLC charts are useful since they show the four major data points over a period, with the closing price being considered the most important by many traders.
* The chart type is useful because it can show increasing or decreasing momentum. When the open and close are far apart it shows strong momentum, and when the open and close are close together it shows indecision or weak momentum. The high and low show the full price range of the period, useful in assessing volatility. There are several patterns traders watch for  OHLC charts.
### CandleStick Chart:
* Candlestick charts are used by traders to determine possible price movement based on past patterns. Candlesticks are useful when trading as they show four price points (open, close, high, and low) throughout the period of time the trader specifies.
* Many algorithms are based on the same price information shown in candlestick charts.Trading is often dictated by emotion, which can be read in candlestick charts.
